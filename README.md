# PwStore

## What is this?

PwStore is a gnome-shell extension that integrates with
[pass](https://www.passwordstore.org) to allow searching and copying passwords
to the clipboard from the gnome shell overview search.

PwStore is inspired by [pass-extension](https://github.com/mcat95/pass-extension/pulls), but works correctly with gnome-shell 3.32.

## License

PwStore is available under the GNU GPL v3.
